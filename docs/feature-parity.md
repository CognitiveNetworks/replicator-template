# Feature Parity Matrix

> Complete list of every user-facing feature, integration, and workflow in the legacy application.
> Each feature gets a status. The rebuild is not complete until every **Must Rebuild** and **Rebuild Improved** feature passes acceptance testing.
>
> See `WINDSURF.md` > Feature Parity Tracking for requirements.
>
> **Organization:** Group features by phase. Phase 1 = core/must-have for launch.
> Phase 2 = important but not blocking launch. Phase 3 = deferred, evaluated later.
> Intentionally Dropped = will never be rebuilt (requires justification).

## Features

### Phase 1 — Core Platform (Must Rebuild / Rebuild Improved)

| Feature | Legacy Behavior | Status | Target Behavior | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | Must Rebuild | | |
| | | Rebuild Improved | | |

### Phase 2 — Extended Services

| Feature | Legacy Behavior | Status | Target Behavior | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | Must Rebuild | | |
| | | Rebuild Improved | | |

### Phase 3 — Deferred

| Feature | Legacy Behavior | Status | Target Behavior | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | Deferred | | N/A |

### Intentionally Dropped

| Feature | Legacy Behavior | Status | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | Intentionally Dropped | |

### Status Definitions

- **Must Rebuild** — feature must exist in the target with equivalent behavior
- **Rebuild Improved** — feature will be rebuilt with specific improvements
- **Intentionally Dropped** — feature will not be rebuilt (requires documented justification below)
- **Deferred** — feature will be rebuilt in a later phase (requires documented justification below)

## Deferred — Justifications

## Intentionally Dropped — Justifications
